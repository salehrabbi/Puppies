            <p>
              Take comfort in our 30 years of 3 family generations dedicated experience to perfecting these
              precious furbabies to the absolute smallest teacup dogs humanly possible! Our family has
              poured our hearts and souls into raising and breeding the worlds smallest teacup dogs from
              early mornings, late nights to sleepless nights. Our kids grew up surrounded by a wonderfuf
              of fur-babies. They learned responsibility, respect and the circle of life at an early age. The
              older our kids got, the more knowledge they absorbed. All our kids knew how to deliver a
              breech baby by 8 years old! Therefore it’s easy to see how my sisters and I became braided
              into the furry fabric to continue the faithful journey of keeping our doll face teacup puppies
              thriving so people would have a highly respected and trustworthy online store that they knew
              had been in business the test of time.
            </p>
            <p>
              All our micro teacup dogs are bred by us, at home, and never brokered or sold via 3rd party.
              We do not have any afliation with any ‘Korean teacup dogs’ (nor should you). We have all the
              teacup puppy parents and can supply photos upon request. We know the history of our
              dollface teacup dogs and intimately know and love each and every teacup puppy we sell, and
              assure you your dollface teacup puppy receives the best care, training and socialization for a
              healthy, happy forever fur friend. We extensively socialize our micro teacup pups from birth
              onward, they come with us by car to our appointments, the hair salon, grocery shopping, our
              general errands, even out to dinners. All this is the most important part for YOU getting a
              confdent (not nervous/yappy) well adjusted happy micro size puppy that will fourish for life
              (10+ years).

            <p>
              We can not guarantee an exact weight because lifestyle factors are not controlled by us. If your

              in their mouth.

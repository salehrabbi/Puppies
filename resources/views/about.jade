          h4.color-yellow.mt-2 Experience Matters – Who We Are 
          p
            | Take comfort in our 30 years of 3 family generations dedicated experience to perfecting these
            | precious furbabies to the absolute smallest teacup dogs humanly possible! Our family has
            | poured our hearts and souls into raising and breeding the worlds smallest teacup dogs from
            | early mornings, late nights to sleepless nights. Our kids grew up surrounded by a wonderfuf
            | of fur-babies. They learned responsibility, respect and the circle of life at an early age. The
            | older our kids got, the more knowledge they absorbed. All our kids knew how to deliver a
            | breech baby by 8 years old! Therefore it’s easy to see how my sisters and I became braided
            | into the furry fabric to continue the faithful journey of keeping our doll face teacup puppies
            | thriving so people would have a highly respected and trustworthy online store that they knew
            | had been in business the test of time.
          p
            | All our micro teacup dogs are bred by us, at home, and never brokered or sold via 3rd party.
            | We do not have any afliation with any ‘Korean teacup dogs’ (nor should you). We have all the
            | teacup puppy parents and can supply photos upon request. We know the history of our
            | dollface teacup dogs and intimately know and love each and every teacup puppy we sell, and
            | assure you your dollface teacup puppy receives the best care, training and socialization for a
            | healthy, happy forever fur friend. We extensively socialize our micro teacup pups from birth
            | onward, they come with us by car to our appointments, the hair salon, grocery shopping, our
            | general errands, even out to dinners. All this is the most important part for YOU getting a
            | confdent (not nervous/yappy) well adjusted happy micro size puppy that will fourish for life
            | (10+ years).
